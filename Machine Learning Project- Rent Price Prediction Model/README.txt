The zip file extracted consists of the following files:
1. Project_Code: This file consists of 
	- Diganth_Project_Code.ipynb : This is the interactive jupyter notebook with the 	project code, outputs and the analysis report

	- metadata.csv : This is an intermediate CSV file used by the jupyter notebook to 	calculate crime scores and consists of crime description, crime severity scores 	and normalised crime severity scores. 
  	
	- 1,2,4,5,6 : These are PNG image files used by the jupyter notebook to display 	images in the markdown analysis

2. Crime_Score_Research_Paper: This folder consists of the research paper that I refereed to obtain the crime severity scores. The research paper can also be accesses at: https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/12/4/439/4092861?redirectedFrom=fulltext


In order to run the project, 

1. Download the Project_Code folder onto your local file system

2. Download the 2 datasets necessary to run the jupyter notebook		
	- Crime Dataset: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z/data
	- Rent Dataset: https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Rent-Price-LA-/4a97-v5tx

Make sure to export data in the CSV format from the above websites. 
For your convenience, both the data files can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1syL3mWc4iuLfh9ScCZHmPgNjgpaTA-sZ?usp=sharing


3. Place both the downloaded dataset files into the Project_Code folder that you downloaded in Step 1

At this stage the Project_Code folder consists of: Diganth_Project_Code.ipynb, metadata.csv, (1,2,4,5,6 PNG images), Crime_Data_from_2010_to_2019.csv and Rent_Price__LA_.csv 

4. Access the Project_Code file from the jupyter notebook console. You will be able to see that the Project_Code folder contains Diganth_Project_Code.ipynb. Open this interactive jupyter notebook. You will be able to view the project code, outputs and analysis. You can also run this file as the datasets have been imported into the directory in steps 2 and 3


You can observe that after the data pre processing phases are completed Project_Database.csv and Final_Database.csv files would be generated by the jupyter notebook and would be stored in the Project_Code folder of your device
